# API :  An API is a set of programming code that allows data to be transferred between software products. It also includes the terms of the data transfer

## Also the API consist of two main thing

1. First thing is about the Technical standard outlining data interchange possibilities across solutions, written as a request for processing and data delivery protocols.

2. Second thing is It's a software interface that's been created according to the standard that represents it.

## API TYPES in general we have four main types for the API and here it is with some simple example for each one

1. Public APIs: A Public Application programming interfaces is open & available to the  user by any outside developer or business for example, if there is a company that develops and offers a public API will have a business strategy that will includes sharing its apps and data with  the other companies in the industry.

2. Partner APIs A Partner Application programming interfaces is a tool for facilitating business-to-business transactions that is only available to a restricted group of outside developers or API users for example, if a company seeks to share customer data selectively with outside  the CRM businesses it can utilize a partner API to link the internal customer data system with those external partners — no other API use is allowed.

3. Private APIs: is A Private Application programming interfaces are intended to improve an organization's solutions & services. These APIs can be used by in-house developers or contractors to integrate a company's IT systems or applications, as well as to create new systems or customer-facing apps that use current systems. Even if applications are made public, the interface is only accessible to individuals that work directly with the API publisher. The private strategy gives a business complete control over API usage also this Private API is designed for internal usage, and such security standards are believed to be in place through other policies, they often have poor security and authentication — or none at all.

4. Composite APIs: is an APIs that are made up of several components. Composite APIs are made up of two or more APIs that work together to provide a series of linked or interdependent actions.
Composite APIs can be useful for addressing complicated or closely linked API behaviors, and they can occasionally outperform individual APIs in terms of speed and performance.

## Now Lets mention the Benefits of The API

1. Save Cost: The cost of developing an app is determined by a number of factors, including the project's complexity, the technology utilized, and the developers' experience. According to one poll, the average cost of building and launching an app is $270,000. The opportunity to save money is one of the most significant advantages of APIs for organizations. Using APIs to construct apps is a fantastic method to cut expenses because they dramatically reduce development work.
Developers may use APIs to get the majority of the functionality they need to build apps from other places, rather than having to start from scratch. They can utilize cost-effective APIs from third-party suppliers or their own internal APIs instead of wasting precious resources and time building the wheel.

2. Build a new product capabilities: Prepping your company's functions and exposing them as an API may be an enticing offer to outside developers who want to build apps on top of them. This enables for the creation of additional specific features that may not have been originally envisioned, in addition to strengthening commercial ties.
Trello, For example, Trello offers a cloud collaboration API that allows third-party developers to create content extensions that Trello would not otherwise generate. Trello's capabilities are expanded with the addition of additional features such as platform-specific message notifications and task checklists. APIs are also useful for keeping products relevant, particularly in this age of rapid technological advancement. For example, eBay offers an eCommerce API that allows third-party developers to customize eBay's shopping platform. Users will have a better purchasing experience, and eBay will remain relevant while expanding its verticals.

3. Enhances customer experience: Enterprises may build innovative and effective methods of connecting with customers by using APIs' capabilities, especially in the present digital age when consumers want top-notch experiences.
Today's clients prefer personalized experiences over one-size-fits-all corporate solutions. Developers can use APIs to design the solutions that can satisfy specific consumer requirements and it would be impossible to do it.
Many companies, for example, utilize APIs to implement cutting-edge artificial intelligence and predictive analytics technology that analyzes a buyer's unique path and suggests the "next best action." This enhances the shopping experience for customers and increases sales.

4. Collects data for intelligence analytics: APIs may provide a simple and rapid method for businesses to extract value from data if they are used seriously. You can track and evaluate how third-party developers use APIs by developing them and releasing them to the public. This provides you with useful information on how clients interact with your products.
You may better understand your target market, discover weak areas in your business' processes, and improve your core products with acquired information analytics. Google, for example, offers a cutting-edge machine learning API that allows third-party developers to integrate cutting-edge AI prediction capabilities into their apps. Because every data point submitted to the API is saved on Google's computers, it makes extensive use of user-generated data to improve the performance of its AI models.

## The Differences Between API & SDK

- API :  An API is a set of programming code that allows data to be transferred between software products. It also includes the terms of the data transfer.

- SDK: A software development kit is a group of software development tools that enable the production of applications for a particular software package, framework, hardware platform, computer system, video game console, operating system, or other development platform and stages.

- The real difference is the api is an interface for service while the SDK is a tools contains components and code the fragments  that was create for specific purpose also the SDK contains an API . When a developer utilizes an SDK to build systems and apps, those applications must interact with one another. An SDK offers an API that allows for this connection. However, while the API may be used for communication, it cannot be utilized to construct a new application.
